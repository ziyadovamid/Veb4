      <h2>Number of banks in Russia from 2001 to 2020</h2>
      <p>
 According to the statistics of the Bank of Russia, the number of banks in the Russian Federation as of 01.01.2020 is 484, that is, over the past year their number has decreased by 42 (484 - 442 = 42).

  <li>JSCB APABANK (JSC) (reg. No. 2404, Moscow - Order of the Bank of Russia dated January 31, 2020 No. OD-166)</li>
  <li>JSC NVKbank (reg. No. 931, Saratov - Order of the Bank of Russia dated January 24, 2020 No. OD-111)</li>
  <li>PJSC CB PFS-BANK (reg. No. 2410, Moscow - Order of the Bank of Russia dated January 17, 2020 No. OD-64)</li>
  <li>CB Neklis-Bank LLC (reg. No. 1671, Moscow - Order of the Bank of Russia dated January 10, 2020 No. OD-6)</li>
</ol>
<p>
It should be noted that the majority of banks are registered mainly in the European part of the country, and very few banks beyond the Urals. The disproportion is also in the fact that 51.4% of Russian banks are registered in Moscow (227 * 100/442).
